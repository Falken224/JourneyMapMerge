# JourneyMapMerge

A quick, crappy little webapp that will let you upload Minecraft Journeymap data, and merge it with other players.

First off . . . install java, install gradle.  Seriously . . . just do it.

Once you've done that:

'gradle jettyRun'

then load up the url:

localhost:8080/jmmerge/

It's a POS right now, but you can upload a zip of your journeymap data, and it'll merge with whatever else is there.

Better UI is coming.  This is a pile of crap at the moment.  Tests, an actual UI and other things are coming.

Have fun.
